# Hi, My Name is: Diane Stukes

Welcome to my Github page!  Here you'll find exciting projects that I have completed in my journey to becoming a Software Engineer.

## Who Am I?

#Professionally:

I am a bright, motivated lady who has blazed a trail in IT in awesome roles such as Help Desk Analyst, Telecommuncations Coordinator, Corporate Trainer and Technical Writer. I have the best of both worlds because on one hand, I love people, I enjoy collaborating with others and seeing projects through succesffully, and on the other hand, I also enjoy focused, detailed work that often requires solo performance and great self-management.

#Personally:

I am an artist, song writer, singer. I love science and nature documentaries, a variety of movie genres, including SCI-FI, Action, Drama, smart, dry Comedy. I also enjoy a variety of music, especially Gospel, Smooth Jazz, and ballads, but also some classical, rock and roll, country.

## Node Notes

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
