# Hi, my name is Diane Stukes

Welcome to my Github page!  Here you'll find exciting projects that I have completed in my journey to becoming a Software Engineer.

## Who Am I?

#Professionally:

I am a bright, motivated lady who has blazed a trail in IT in awesome roles such as Help Desk Analyst, Telecommuncations Coordinator, Corporate Trainer and Technical Writer. I have the best of both worlds because on one hand, I love people, I enjoy collaborating with others and seeing projects through succesffully, and on the other hand, I also enjoy focused, detailed work that often requires solo performance and great self-management.

#Personally:

I am an artist, song writer, singer. I love science and nature documentaries, a variety of movie genres, including SCI-FI, Action, Drama, smart, dry Comedy. I also enjoy a variety of music, especially Gospel, Smooth Jazz, and ballads, but also some classical, rock and roll, country.
