#Assignment to Create an Isobar 

## Distributed by Sensor Products, Inc. for Software Engineer position

# Completed by Diane Stukes on Friday, March 25, 2022

#  Note:  I submitted my assignment as pictures via email as proof of completion until I complete creating and deploying a repo in Github. During this process, I did notice 3 other minor adjustments needed:
- smaller table width, - switch to left alignment, -and removal of unused component styles.css.

#  As a final test, I reviewed the rendered React page in my localhost 3002 web page.
#  I also create this Readme file and will create a production build for deployment. Afterwards, I will provide a link to my repo, although much later in the evening than desired.
